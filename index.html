							<h2>IEEE UCF</h2>
							<p>Under my leadership as two-time president, IEEE has seen great success and growth that has impacted the likes of numerous UCF engineers. From a commitment to ambitious technical projects and workshops to the growth of a flourishing community of over 300 members, a diversity of opportunity and activity overflowed.<br><a href="https://ieee.cecs.ucf.edu/"><b>Click here to learn more!</b></a>

							<h2>RISES Center</h2>
							<p>With the digitalization of the electrical power grid, there has been a dramatic increase in the potential for our critical infrastructure to be vulnerable to cyber integrity attacks. My thesis research examines these weaknesses and proposes algorithms to defend the industry at large from attacks.<br><a href="https://stars.library.ucf.edu/honorstheses/1183/"><b>Click here to learn more!</b></a></p>

The hybrid energy storage system consisting of both a lithium battery pack and an ultracapacitor bank is looking to make more efficient EVs that can extend the lifecycle of lithium batteries. Our team is currently converting a combustion go-kart to a proof-of-concept vehicle under my leadership and seeks to impact the research community with our published findings.<br><a href="https://oxford-abstracts.s3.amazonaws.com/516199d5-68b0-405d-9d29-8d094d260e4e.pdf"><b>Click here to learn more!</b></a></p>

							<h2>VISION - Billiards for the Blind</h2>
							<p style="background-color: #1f2224;">Visually Impaired Spatially Interactive Orientation Network
								<br>Most Senior Design projects seek to be a showcase of skills to merely get a degree in hand. My team and I instead took this requirement as an opportunity to go above and beyond and innovate a project with the potential to benefit those with less fortunate circumstances. VISION seeks to create a user & table interface to give the visually impaired the ability to enjoy the game of pool. Our project combines aspects of computer vision, AI, audio guidance, and more to create a proof of concept for this idea and open the door for further innovation in the space.<br></a>

							<h2>Intro to Engineering TA</h2>
							<p>Giving back to the community that brought me up has been at the core of my ambitions at UCF. My initial engineering experiences stemmed from working with robots and building a boat for my intro to engineering course, and now I am grateful to give back by teaching freshmen the ins and outs of technichal skills and what it means to be an engineer!<br></p>

							<h2>Linear Circuits LA</h2>
							<p>Under the guidance of Dr. ChungYong Chan, I had the privilege to help students learn and grow through learning the core electrical engineering knowledge imparted through linear circuits. Assisting students through some of the most challenging and fundamental topics of their major with weekly discussion sessions allowed me to work one-on-one and for the class at large on practice problems and important techniques. These methods allowed students to improve their retention of this knowledge for test day, and saw amazing results under our team’s guidance!</p>

							<h2>Autonomous Disinfection Robot</h2>
							<p>In 2020, IEEE Region 3 set out on a mission to inspire the next generation of engineers to work to combat the world's problems through innovation via their pandemic project initiative. IEEE UCF heard the call to action and we began to design an autonomous surface disinfection robot to clear surfaces of UCF’s Health Services Center in a manner that would keep all attendants safe and healthy. By the use of path-finding algorithms and UVC radiation, this robot seeks to combat COVID-19 and all viruses.<br><a href=""><b>Click here to learn more!</b></a></p>
